---Notes---
This map was made to be included in the AG Mod Arena map pack. It is primarily a 1v1 map but there are 8 spawn points
so i suppose that is the maximum.

E-mail me with any comments on the level, praise or criticism. This is easily my best map to date, and is the first that
i have released. All my other maps have been experimental to test out ideas and to learn worldcraft's tools etc... Any
feedback is much appreciated, as maybe my next work will be better for it :)

---Special thanks---
Testers and Helpers - Groo, JL, Vio, AG mod peeps [Bullit and CHiNX that i know of], Alborac, my offline m8ies, and anyone
else who played the map during testing, esp. Pana for setting up a server for us :)
All of my HL clan, Colonial Marines, for spreading the power of WHOOPAH far and wide; and covering my hide in those firefights :)
Everyone in the wireplay HL community [especially to all those in #wphl] for their heartwarming banter :)
All the peeps running the show that we like to call HLCCL.
All the wireplay HL admins for changing maps and gravity settings ;)
As usual, Valve...
Most of the sites over at Planet Half-Life for being so damned good!
